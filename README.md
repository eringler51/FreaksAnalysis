# FreaksAnalysis
Analyzing data from my complicated, custom fantasy football leagues to find the optimal strategy.

adp.py was practice in scraping PPG data from MFL and cleaning the dataframe

offense_analysis and defense_analysis produce a dataframe displaying the rate at which flex players come from each position.

team_worp is a future project
